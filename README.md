# Climate Impact Taxonomy 

### Overview

This repository contains the code for the online version of the climate impact taxonomy developed by the International Institute for Applied Systems Analysis [(IIASA)](www.iiasa.ac.at) and ClimateWorks Foundation [(CWF)](https://www.climateworks.org/). The climate impact taxonomy file included in this repository is also published on Zenodo: [https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.17711315](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.17711315)

### Taxonomy description

This is designed to capture the breadth of climate impacts and to map them onto different risk dimensions, while pointing to adaptation and mitigation linkages. The taxonomy uses the IPCC AR6 Working Group I and II assessments as main references and applies the IPCC concepts of Climatic Impact-Drivers (CIDs) and Representative Key Risks (RKRs) as guiding taxonomy categories. The taxonomy does NOT provide a comprehensive or exhaustive analysis of all climate impacts, but is intended to help the user improve their understanding of the diverse climate impact landscape and to facilitate a more targeted exploration of research engagement opportunities

### Taxonomy use

The taxonomy is targeted at users from philanthropies engaging in the climate space and any non-experts interested in learning more about the climate impact landscape. For each RKR-specific ensemble of CIDs, the taxonomy provides more specific climate impact information grouped in five broad categories: Climate Impact Characteristics; Climate Impact Assessment; Adaptation Linkages; Mitigation Linkages, IPCC AR6 & AR7 Chapter References.
